# Chatwoot-WASP Appium Java Selenium Test Project

## Overview

This project is an automated test framework built using **Appium** and **Selenium WebDriver** in **Java**. It is designed for mobile testing of the **Chatwoot-WASP** application. 
The framework uses **TestNG** as the test runner and **ExtentReports** for generating visual test reports. The tests are organized into different classes based on features such 
as **Conversations**, **Contacts**, **Login**, and **Settings**.

### Key Files and Directories:

- **`src/test/java/tests`**: Contains the main test classes for different features:
  - `BaseTest.java`: Sets up and tears down the Appium driver, along with common utilities for tests.
  - `ContactsTest.java`: Tests related to managing and interacting with contacts.
  - `ConversationsTest.java`: Tests for verifying the conversations screen and its functionalities.
  - `LoginTest.java`: Tests for login functionality.
  - `SettingsTest.java`: Tests related to the settings screen.

- **`test-output`**: Holds the reports generated by the test execution:
  - `ConversationsTestReport.html`: Report specific to the conversations test cases.
  - `LoginTestReport.html`: Report for login-related tests.
  - `emailable-report.html` and `index.html`: Summary and detailed reports generated by TestNG.

- **`pom.xml`**: The Maven configuration file that defines dependencies and plugins for building the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed on your system:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** (version 11 or higher)
- **Maven** (for managing dependencies and building the project)
- **Appium** (Appium server should be running and configured)
- **Android SDK** (for running tests on Android devices or emulators)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone (https://github.com/AJEETKSINGH1001/Chatwoot-WASP)
   
Framework Features
Modular Test Design: The tests are modular and organized by feature for easy maintenance and scalability.
ExtentReports Integration: Provides visually appealing reports showing test case results and errors.
Reusable Utilities: Common utilities like login and element waiters are included in the BaseTest.java to reduce code duplication.
Troubleshooting
Driver Initialization Issues:

Ensure the Appium server is running and connected to the correct port.
Check that the device/emulator is connected and accessible via adb.
Test Failures:

Review the logs and reports generated under the test-output directory.
Confirm that test element locators (like IDs and XPaths) match the app's current version.
Report Generation:

Ensure ExtentReports initialization code is present in the @BeforeClass method and that the flush method is called in the @AfterClass method.
